## Project Name POO With JAVA

# Description

This Java application demonstrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating Person and Major classes and establishing relationships between them. It showcases basic object creation, attribute assignment, and method invocation.

#Functionality

- Object Creation: The application creates two Person objects (p1 and p2) and two Major objects (m1 and m2).
- Attribute Assignment: It assigns values to the attributes of each object:
 > Person: name, lastname, age, and major (a reference to a Major object)
 > Major: name, duration (years), start_year, and ended (boolean indicating completion)

# Method Calls:
- giveFullName(): Retrieves the full name of a Person object.
- infoMajor(): Provides information about a Major object, likely including its name and completion status.
- greeting(Person other): Potentially generates a greeting message from one Person to another (implementation details not shown).

# Output
The application prints information about the two Person objects to the console, including their full names, ages, and major details (if the infoMajor() method provides that information). It might also display a greeting message from one person to the other, depending on the greeting() method's implementation.
